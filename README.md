# Introduction
According to a publication on [Researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353107608_Accuracy_of_a_Smartphone_Application_Measuring_Snoring_in_Adults-How_Smart_Is_It_Actually):

### About 40% of the adult population is affected by snoring, which is closely related to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and can be associated with serious health implications. Commercial smartphone applications (apps) offer the possibility of monitoring snoring at home. However, the number of validation studies addressing snoring apps is limited. 

The purpose of the present study is to help the client and their partner analyze their sleeping activity recorded on an app each night.

---

# Problem Statement

The app collects lots of different data points including a snore detector. 
The client's partner snores very loudly during the night. The client believes that they do not snore.
The client believes that the app is incorrectly tracking their partners snoring and impacting the quality of their data.

Using the data provided:

- Find out who is snoring, the Client or their partner?
- Provide the client with some recommendations based on the data to improve the quality of their sleep.

# Data Sourcing

This Datasets were presented by [The Numerist](https://www.numerist.co.uk/home) and available at:

- [Client Sleep Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kbqybVVTf4lqVgU21eSf_j4vdLe2xhMBVDZhZMqY3QY/copy)
- [Partner Sleep Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kbqybVVTf4lqVgU21eSf_j4vdLe2xhMBVDZhZMqY3QY/copy)

# Data Transformation

Data transformation was done in Power Query and the datasets were loaded into Microsoft Power BI Desktop for modeling.

- Client Sleep Data consists of `21 columns and 111 rows` of observations
- Partner Sleep Data consists of `21 columns and 77 rows` of observations

In Power query the tables that contains the datasets are named:
-  `Client`
-  `Partner` respectively.

After careful observation each of the tables have same column names, hence:

The tabulation below shows the column names and their description:
| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Start | Represents the start date and time of the observation |
| End | Represents the end date and time of the observation |
| Sleep Quality | Represents the location of the accident |
| Regularity | Represents the airline or the operator of the aircraft |
| Mood | Represents the flight ID assigned by the aircraft operator |
| Heart Rate(bmp) | Represents the  complete or partial route flown prior to the accident |
| Steps | Represents the aircraft type |
| Alarm Mode | Represents ICAO registration of the aircraft |
| Air Pressure | Represents the construction or serial number/line or fuselage number |
| City | Represents the total number of people aboard the plane |
| Movements | Represents the number of fatalities |
| Time in Bed | Represnts the total number of people killed on the ground by the aircraft |
| Time Asleep | Contains brief description of the accident and cause if known |
| Time before sleep | Represents the start date and time of the observation |
| Window Start | Represents the end date and time of the observation |
| Window Stop | Represents the location of the accident |
| Did Snore | Represents the airline or the operator of the aircraft |
| Snore Time | Represents the flight ID assigned by the aircraft operator |
| Weather Temperature | Represents the  complete or partial route flown prior to the accident |
| Weather Type | Represents the aircraft type |
| Notes | Represents ICAO registration of the aircraft |

- To clean the data, power query was used to check the column's profile, quality, and distribution. it was found out that some columns were missing some values.

The table below shows the number of missing values in each of the columns:
| Column Name | No. of missing values |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Date | 0 |
| Time | 684 |
| Location | 8 |
| Operator | 12 |
| Flight | 897 |
| Route | 531 |
| Type | 19 |
| Registration | 155 |
| Cn/Ln | 463 |
| Aboard | 0 |
| Fatalities | 0 |
| Ground | 0 |
| Summary | 243 |

- To account for the missing values, each column containing a missing value had to be manipulated.

The table below shows each of the column with a missing value and the kind of manipulation that was done:
| Column Name | Data manipulation |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Time | Replaced the missing values with an arbitrary time values - (00:00) |
| Location | Replaced the missing values with 'unknown'|
| Operator | Replaced the missing values with 'unknown' |
| Flight | Replaced the missing values with 'unknown' |
| Type | Replaced the missing values with 'unknown' |
| Registration | Replaced the missing values with 'unknown' |
| Cn/Ln | Replaced the missing values with 'unknown' |
| Summary | Replaced the missing values with 'unknown' |

After the columns with missing values were manipulated, each column in the table `Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_since_1908`  was then validated to have the correct data type to ensure data accuracy.

- Given that we have numerous dates and time in the dataset, a date table was needed so as to reference the date and the time more accurately.
A date table was created with the M-formula `List.Dates(#date(1908,09,17), 365*101, #duration(1,0,0,0)`

Here is a breakdown of what the formula does:

For `Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_since_1908` data, we want the start date to reflect the earliest date that we have in the data: September 17, 1908. Additionally, you want to see date for the 101 years(time frame for our anlysis), including dates in the future.This approach ensures that, as new airplane crash and fatalities data flows in you won't have to re-create this table.Also the duration represents data point for everyday.

The date table was named `Calender` and the flight column was renamed to `Flight ID` for clarity.

---

# Data Modeling

After the data was cleaned and transformed, it was ready to be modeled.
- In the `Calender` table, `calculated columns` was used to extract the `Day`,` Month`, `Quarter`, `Year` columns from the table.

For `Day`, we used the DAX expression `FORMAT(Calender[Dates],'DDDD')`

For `Month`, we used the DAX expression `MONTH(Calender[Dates])`

For `Day`, we used the DAX expression `QUARTER(Calender[Dates])`

For `Day`, we used the DAX expression `YEAR(Calender[Dates])`

- An hierarchy was created in the `Calender` table to include the following columns: `Day`,` Month`, `Quarter`, `Year`
- The `Calender` table was then marked as the official date table in the dataset.
- To reference the date and time in the `Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_since_1908` table more accurately, a `one-to-many (*:1) relationship` was created between the 
`Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_since_1908` and the `Calender` table using the `Dates` column in each of the tables.

# Data Visualization

Data visualization for the dataset was done in two folds:
- `Annual Analysis`: Shows the number of accidents, fatalities, location, etc. for a previously selected year
- `Data Summary 1908 - 2009`: Shows all the data from the whole period, including the total number of accidents and total number of fatalities by year, operator and aircraft type.

- Figure 1 shows visualizations from `Annual Analysis`

# Data Analysis

- For [Figure 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106287208/180833146-0c593368-94fd-4550-9177-cec32cc32ab0.png), a measure was created using the DAX `Total Fatalities = SUM(Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_since_1908[Aboard] + SUM(Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_since_1908[Ground])` to aggregrate the total number of fatalities for each year.

see Figure 3 below:
| Figure 3 |
| ----------- |
| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106287208/180865767-0c9d6bf9-6032-4ec0-a932-39544596880c.png) |

- From [Figure 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106287208/180864176-aee4c729-d6de-41e8-b2ca-68192671476c.png), It looks like Aeroflot has the highest number of accidents for all the time specified by the dataset.

See Figure 4 below:
| Figure 4 |

PJSC Aeroflot â€“ Russian Airlines, commonly known as Aeroflot, is the flag carrier and largest airline of the Russian Federation. The carrier is an open joint stock company that operates domestic and international passenger and services, mainly from its hub at Sheremetyevo International Airport.

Also the data point for fatalities on ground for the year 2001 appears to look like an outlier, however the 9/11 attacks against targets in the United States contibuted to a massive rise in total fatalities (on ground) for the year.

See Figure 5 below:
| Figure 5 |
| ----------- |
| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106287208/180882364-a55df9fc-f344-43d1-9779-ae38bf74cb8c.png) |

From our 'Annual Analysis' for the year 2001 it is estimated that they were a total of:

`60 accidents`, `7752 fatalities`, `2111 people killed abord`, `5641 people killed on the ground`.
See Figure 6 below:
| Figure 6 |
| ----------- |
| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106287208/180875463-3b6f81c7-242f-433d-9daf-01d9d66f1559.png) |

It was also found that, about `2880 people were killed on ground` from the 9/11 attacks against target in the USA.
Find out more at [9/11 attacks](https://www.britannica.com/event/September-11-attacks)

Generally for the dataset, they were a total of `5268 Accidents` resulting in about `153K Fatalities` spanning a period of `102` years.
