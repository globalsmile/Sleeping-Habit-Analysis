# Introduction
According to a publication on [Researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353107608_Accuracy_of_a_Smartphone_Application_Measuring_Snoring_in_Adults-How_Smart_Is_It_Actually):

### About 40% of the adult population is affected by snoring, which is closely related to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and can be associated with serious health implications. Commercial smartphone applications (apps) offer the possibility of monitoring snoring at home. However, the number of validation studies addressing snoring apps is limited. 

The purpose of the present study is to help the client and their partner analyze their sleeping activity recorded on an app each night.

---

# Problem Statement

The app collects lots of different data points including a snore detector. 
The client's partner snores very loudly during the night. The client believes that they do not snore.
The client believes that the app is incorrectly tracking their partners snoring and impacting the quality of their data.

Using the data provided:

- Find out who is snoring, the Client or their partner?
- Provide the client with some recommendations based on the data to improve the quality of their sleep.

# Data Sourcing

This Datasets were presented by [The Numerist](https://www.numerist.co.uk/home) and available at:

- [Client Sleep Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kbqybVVTf4lqVgU21eSf_j4vdLe2xhMBVDZhZMqY3QY/copy)
- [Partner Sleep Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kbqybVVTf4lqVgU21eSf_j4vdLe2xhMBVDZhZMqY3QY/copy)

# Data Transformation

Data transformation was done in Power Query and the datasets were loaded into Microsoft Power BI Desktop for modeling.

- Client Sleep Data consists of `21 columns and 111 rows` of observations
- Partner Sleep Data consists of `21 columns and 77 rows` of observations

In Power query the tables that contains the datasets are named:
-  `Client`
-  `Partner` respectively.

After careful observation each of the tables have same column names, hence:

The tabulation below shows the column names and their description:
| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Start | Represents the start date and time of the observation |
| End | Represents the end date and time of the observation |
| Sleep Quality | Represnts the quality of sleep of an individual around a certain time |
| Regularity | Represents the regularity of sleep of an individual  around a certain time |
| Mood | Blank Column |
| Heart Rate(bmp) | Represents the heart rate of an individual  around a certain time |
| Steps | Represents the number of steps taken by an individual in a day |
| Alarm Mode | Describes the alarm mode the individual has set |
| Air Pressure | Represents the air pressure in the room |
| City | Blank Column |
| Movements | Represents the number of movements made by the individual around a certain time |
| Time in Bed | Represents the time in bed in seconds  |
| Time Asleep | Represents the time asleep in seconds |
| Time before sleep | Represents the time before sleep in seconds |
| Window Start | Represents the window start date and time |
| Window Stop | Represents the window stop date and time |
| Did Snore | Describes the snoring sound |
| Snore Time | Represents the snore time of an individual in seconds |
| Weather Temperature | Represents the tempaerature of the weather around a certain time |
| Weather Type | Describes the weather type |
| Notes | Blank Column |

Data Cleaning for the 2 datasets was done in power query as follows:

- Unnecessary columns were removed. The remaining columns were tailored to provide answers to the [Problem Statement](https://github.com/globalsmile/Airline-Analysis#Problem-Statement) and are shown below:

| Column Name |
| ----------- | 
| End | 
| Sleep Quality | 
| Regularity | 
| Time in Bed | 
| Time Asleep | 
| Snore Time |

- Validated the accuracy of the of `End` column by changing the type to `date only`
- Removed error rows from the `End` column

To ensure the accuracy of the dates in the `End` column, a date table was created for referencing using the M-formula:

`List.Dates(#date(2020,01,01), 365*1, #duration(1,0,0,0)`

Here is a breakdown of what the formula does:

For the 2 datasets, we want the start date to reflect the earliest date that we have in the data: January 01, 2020. Additionally, you want to see date for 1 year(time frame for our anlysis), including dates in the future.This approach ensures that, as new observation flows in we won't have to re-create this table.Also the duration represents observation for everyday.

The date table was named `Calender`.

# Data Modeling

After the datasets were cleaned and transformed, it was ready to be modeled.

- The `Calender` table was then marked as the official date table in the dataset.
- To reference the dates in the `End` column of the 2 tables named `Client` and `Partner` respectively more accurately, a `one-to-many (*:1) relationship` was created between the 
`Client` and the `Calender` tables using the dates column in each of the tables, also a `one-to-many (*:1) relationship` was created between the 
`Partner` and the `Calender` tables using the dates column in each of the tables in a `Star Schema` as shown below:

After [Data Visualization](https://github.com/globalsmile/Airline-Analysis#Data-Visualization), the all the columns in both the `Client` and `Partner` tables were hidden.

# Data Visualization

Data visualization for the dataset was done in two folds:
- `Annual Analysis`: Shows the number of accidents, fatalities, location, etc. for a previously selected year
- `Data Summary 1908 - 2009`: Shows all the data from the whole period, including the total number of accidents and total number of fatalities by year, operator and aircraft type.

- Figure 1 shows visualizations from `Annual Analysis`

# Data Analysis

- For [Figure 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106287208/180833146-0c593368-94fd-4550-9177-cec32cc32ab0.png), a measure was created using the DAX `Total Fatalities = SUM(Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_since_1908[Aboard] + SUM(Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_since_1908[Ground])` to aggregrate the total number of fatalities for each year.

see Figure 3 below:
| Figure 3 |
| ----------- |
| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106287208/180865767-0c9d6bf9-6032-4ec0-a932-39544596880c.png) |

- From [Figure 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106287208/180864176-aee4c729-d6de-41e8-b2ca-68192671476c.png), It looks like Aeroflot has the highest number of accidents for all the time specified by the dataset.

See Figure 4 below:
| Figure 4 |

| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106287208/180882778-6b87c2f1-975f-4730-adb2-15609ddf3883.png) |

PJSC Aeroflot â€“ Russian Airlines, commonly known as Aeroflot, is the flag carrier and largest airline of the Russian Federation. The carrier is an open joint stock company that operates domestic and international passenger and services, mainly from its hub at Sheremetyevo International Airport. (c) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroflot)

Also the data point for fatalities on ground for the year 2001 appears to look like an outlier, however the 9/11 attacks against targets in the United States contibuted to a massive rise in total fatalities (on ground) for the year.

See Figure 5 below:
| Figure 5 |
| ----------- |
| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106287208/180882364-a55df9fc-f344-43d1-9779-ae38bf74cb8c.png) |

From our 'Annual Analysis' for the year 2001 it is estimated that they were a total of:

`60 accidents`, `7752 fatalities`, `2111 people killed abord`, `5641 people killed on the ground`.
See Figure 6 below:
| Figure 6 |
| ----------- |
| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106287208/180875463-3b6f81c7-242f-433d-9daf-01d9d66f1559.png) |

It was also found that, about `2880 people were killed on ground` from the 9/11 attacks against target in the USA.
Find out more at [9/11 attacks](https://www.britannica.com/event/September-11-attacks)

Generally for the dataset, they were a total of `5268 Accidents` resulting in about `153K Fatalities` spanning a period of `102` years.
